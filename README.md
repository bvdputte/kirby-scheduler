# Kirby Scheduled Pages

**Version 0.1**

Write the pages today, automatically publish them at a set date/time in the future.

Based on [Kirby Scheduled Pages](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-scheduled-pages/)

## Installation

1. Add `scheduler` plugin folder into `/site/plugins/`

## Warning

The autopublish feature kinda defeats the cache purpose, but might be handy at times.
