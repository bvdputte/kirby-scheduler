# Kirby Scheduled Pages

**Version 0.1**

*Require Kirby 2.3*

Write the pages today, automatically publish them at a set date/time in the future.

Based on [Kirby Scheduled Pages](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-scheduled-pages/)

## Installation

1. Add `scheduler` plugin folder into `/site/plugins/`
2. Enable "autopublish" via the config option: 'plugin.scheduler.autopublish'
2. Set folder to "watch" via the option 'plugin.scheduler.folderuid'

## Warning

The autopublish feature kinda defeats the cache purpose, but might be handy at times.
